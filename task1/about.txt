Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their
measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to
their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the
measurements of the iris species and classify them.

Although the Scikit-learn library provides a dataset for iris flower classification, you can also
download the same dataset from here for the task of iris flower classification with Machine
Learning.
